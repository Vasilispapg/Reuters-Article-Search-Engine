# Reuters Search Engine

The Reuters Search Engine is a Java application that utilizes the Lucene library to create a custom search engine for a database of nearly 10,000 Reuters articles. The application allows users to perform searches using both the vector space model and phrase search techniques. Built with JavaFX, it offers a user-friendly interface for interacting with the search engine and managing the database.
